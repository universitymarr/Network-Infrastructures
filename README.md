## Notes
Notes are taken during lesson / videolesson ( recordings are provided time to time by teachers ) and I ordered them with ChatGpt ( so may be unseen errors ). Furthermore take pdf files are taken with [Notion](https://www.notion.so/desktop). Unlucky notes may be have unformatted things due to exportation ( e.g. the title at the end of a page result in a bad visual breaks ); I have tried to create a latex files but it take so long. If you want to edit them, you can convert them word files.
